A symbolic lock implementation for Go.

## Introduction

SymLocks provide mutual exclusion on a string value rather than a specific lock object. This can be useful in situations where the complete set of mutex points isnâ€™t immediately known, or may be too large for up front setup to be practical.


## Example

Use a SymLock like this:

```go
var s symlock.SymLock

s.WithMutex("some string value symbolising a mutex point", func() {
    // Do some things which require mutexing on something represented by the provided string
})
```

All code using the same SymLock with the same string will be mutexed from each other:

```go
go s.WithMutex("apple", func() {
    // Do some stuff
})

go s.WithMutex("apple", func() {
    // Do some more stuff, with mutually exclusive locking from the above
})

go s.WithMutex("pear", func() {
    // Do some stuff that can run concurrently with code using "apple" as
    // the mutex symbol, but not with other code that might be using "pear"
})
```
